# WavePods – Original Project

This is an **original project**, created from scratch by me with the goal of practicing frontend development and interface design.

-  All layout ideas, structure, and animations were conceived and developed by me.
-  Built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
- Focus: practicing reusable components, animations with Framer Motion, and styling with Material UI.

## About the Project
