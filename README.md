# 🚀 WavePods – Original Project

This is an **original project**, created from scratch by me with the goal of practicing frontend development and interface design.

- ✨ All layout ideas, structure, and animations were conceived and developed by me.  
- 🧩 Built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).  
- 🎨 Focus: practicing reusable components, animations with Framer Motion, and styling with Material UI.
